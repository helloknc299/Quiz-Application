# Quiz-Application
Concepts Used:
-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Uses classes (Question and QuizApplication) to structure the code efficiently.
-Collection Framework (ArrayList) – Stores quiz questions dynamically using ArrayList<Question>.
-Exception Handling – Ensures safe user input handling with try-catch blocks.
-Java Scanner Class – Takes user input for answering quiz questions.
-Control Flow Statements – Uses loops (for, while) and conditionals (if-else) for quiz logic.
-Encapsulation – Uses private variables with getters to prevent direct access.
